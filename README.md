Zend-Framework-Learning-Modules
===============================

Zend Framework Learning Modules is a project that contains a set of ready to use modules for the
Zend Framework (1.x series). Each one is there to accompany a lesson or post from 
[maltblue.com](http://www.maltblue.com/). So please don't expect that there will be a full MVC install ready to use. 

Take the existing modules, as per the lesson and drop them in to your projects and play around 
with them, learn from them, improve on the ideas and take them where you want.
